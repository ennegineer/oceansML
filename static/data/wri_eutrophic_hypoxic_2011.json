Stratification is an important factor in the formation of hypoxia. Mixing has improved conditions with the opening of the Dawesville Channel which regularly flushes the estuary using tidal flow. However, many worry that the improvements are only a temporary fix as high nutrient loading continues. Due to influx of water from the channel, algal blooms are now occurring less in the Bay, but are still prevalent upriver. ",

  "Comment ": "The Swan\/Avon River drains a large catchment area (121,000 square kilometers) and flows to the ocean through the city of Perth. The type of soil (sandy), land clearance, and Mediterranean climate of the region is considered to contribute to the eutrophic process. Most of the catchment area has been cleared of vegetation since European colonization in the 1800s and transformed into agricultural land with shallow-rooted\/seasonal crops leading to an increase in surface runoff. Increase in urban development\/population is also considered to be a leading cause of nutrient inputs into the estuary. Naturally low nutrient levels in soils in this area have resulted in applications of superphosphate. High levels of phosphorus leaching from to these applications are responsible for regular phytoplankton blooms in the Swan-Canning Estuary. Phosphorus concentrations have doubled or tripled since the 1940s. Low oxygen is related to seasonal rainfall and runoff that increases nutrient loads from developed land. A major harmful algal bloom was reported in the year 2000. ",

The port of Falmouth lies at the mouth of the Fal estuary and is the principal port of Cornwall. The EU's Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive has classified the Fal Estuary as a sensitive, eutrophic area. The estuary experiences harmful algal blooms and has experienced outbreaks of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) which led to prohibitions against shellfish gathering in 1995 and 1996. Nutrient inputs to the estuary primarily originate from nonpoint sources such as agriculture. However, the Newham sewage treatment plant, which discharges directly into the upper reaches of the estuary, is also a significant source.",

The Cork Main Drainage Project which redirected discharge of raw sewage to a wastewater treatment plant rather than directly into Lough Mahon is primarily responsible for the estuary's improvements.",

  "Comment ": "Paracas Bay is an important fishing area in close proximity to fishing industries located in the port of Pisco. Fishing, fish meal manufacturing, and fish and shellfish farming are the region's most important economic activities. These activities are often disrupted by harmful algal blooms (HABs) which kill fish and  shellfish by producing toxins and causing hypoxic and anoxic conditions to develop. Economic losses as a result of HABs have been considerable: Pisco's share of total Peruvian anchovy landings decreased from 8.4 percent in 2003 to 1.7 percent in 2004 following a massive HAB. That same HAB event led to the temporary closure of canneries in Pisco to reduce effluents; economic losses due to port closure were estimated at about $27.5 million. Finally local aquaculture operations reported losses estimated at $1 million after the 2004 HAB event. An estimated area of 2,000 square kilometers has been affected by episodic hypoxia in the past decade. ",

  "Comment ": "Strangford Lough is a large fjordic sea lough on the east coast of Northern Ireland. The two main freshwater flows into Strangford Lough are the Comber (Enler) and the Quoile Rivers. The Strangford Lough catchment area is approximately 770 square kilometers. Land in the catchment is predominantly agricultural and supports beef and dairy cattle with some intensive arable farming in the Comber catchment around the northern end of the Lough. There are 36 wastewater treatment works in the Strangford Lough catchment, serving a population of approximately 91,000. It is estimated that 87 percent of total nitrogen and 37 percent of total phosphorus entering the Lough originates from agricultural sources with the remainder attributable to wastewater treatment works. The upper part of Strangford Lough has elevated nutrient levels as a result of riverine nutrient inputs. Algal blooms have been observed in the summer months, and eel grass communities have been negatively impacted by opportunistic blue-green algae which smother the eel grass beds. Eutrophication symptoms are observed to be fairly mild, but with a chance of worsening if steps are not taken to reduce nutrient inputs. Hypoxia has been observed in the past decade.",

These mortalities have been linked to sewage effluents and overflows of screened storm sewage during wet weather conditions. As of 2008, investments in improved sewage treatment were underway. The Loughor Estuary and the freshwater River Loughor (upstream of Loughor Bridge) have been designated as Sensitive Areas (eutrophic) under the EU's Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. This directive prescribes minimum levels of treatment and provides for nutrient removal where receiving waters are classified as sensitive arising from their eutrophic status. Further studies are ongoing to determine if the Loughor Estuary should also be designated as a Polluted Water (eutrophic) under the Nitrate Directive. Should this follow, then the catchment area would become a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone and all farms in this area would be subject to new regulatory controls, such as restrictions on the use of fertilizers.

Mobile Bay poses an exception to the summer patterns of hypoxia seen throughout most of the Gulf of Mexico as it experiences hypoxia throughout the entire bay at any time in the year. Winter stratification plays an important role here. Some records show that the bay may have been hypoxic in the 1800s. Although some improvements were made in oxygen levels between the 1990s and 2000s, the bottom is still affected by hypoxia. The greatest area of concern is east of the Mobile Ship Channel in the middle and upper bay. These dredged channels complicate the mixing patterns for the otherwise shallow bay.

An estimated area of 261 square kilometers has been affected by episodic hypoxia in the past decade as a result of hurricane disturbances. The Charlotte Harbor estuarine system is an area of critical concern within the state of Florida due to rapid population growth as the surrounding counties have almost tripled in population size since 1970.

The Port of Brunswick is one of the nation's most productive ports on the Atlantic coast. The shrimp industry is still important economically, and the port is also important for U.S. auto manufacturers. Reports from 1985 indicated low summer DO concentration in St Simons Sound which might have resulted from excess municipal and industrial sewage although the hypoxic area was considered to be confined to a small area. In particular, Brunswick Harbor was considered to be significantly influenced by organic solid inputs deriving from seafood-related industrial discharges, urban runoff, sewage, etc. During late 1970s and early 1980s the lowest recorded DO concentrations (mg\/l) in stations located within the system were of 1.9 (Turtle River) and 2.0 (Brunswick Harbor). However, annual mean values were reported to be > 5. Reports also indicate that low DO concentrations might be due to natural processes typical of estuarine systems in the Georgia Coast. However, restricted mixing, high nutrient loading and algal activity in areas surrounding Brunswick Harbor were considered to lead to stress and low DO concentrations. There is a general lack of data to assess current conditions in the estuary. However, conditions in the area are expected to deteriorate by 2020 due to an increase of urbanization.",

Today, as much as 250 square kilometers of the benthic environment can be affected by hypoxia. The problem is the most severe and persistent in the southeastern part of the Lake from salinity stratification from saline introduction via the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet and the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal.

In 1998, the estuary was listed as a “coastal water priority zone” by the State of Maine due to concerns of bacterial concentration, dissolved oxygen levels, and threats from development. Additionally, one station located in the estuary reported continuous hypoxic conditions even when not expected (winter).  However, the cause of such condition remains unknown and is could be a localized issue (close to the harbor) and not predominant in the estuary since an eutrophication assessment (ASSETS) of the area categorizes the system as experiencing “low” symptoms. Conditions are expected to worsen in the near future due to housing development in the area. ",

The main tributaries entering the bay include the Susquehanna, Patuxuent, Potomac, Rappahannock, James and York Rivers. The once productive crab, oyster and menhaden fisheries have been severely diminished as a result of poor water quality in the bay. The Bay receives nutrients and sediments from agricultural runoff, atmospheric deposition, and urban wastewater. Seasonal anoxia is detected in sediment records as far back as 1934-1948; the area affected by seasonal hypoxia is roughly 2,750 square kilometers. Low oxygen levels increased from 1980 to 2000, and the area of hypoxia and anoxia has also increased. The events cause mortality at the sea bottom, although bottom-dwelling species typically recover within a year. Crabs have also been found dead in fishers' pots during hypoxic episodes.",

Seasonal hypoxia has been observed since the 1980s in the Herring River and it is typically anoxic for one to three weeks each year following heavy rains which increase runoff and release wetland organic matter. Stream hypoxia here results from the temperature dependent increase in oxygen demand of organic matter that is released from the diked salt marsh deposits. The dike was built in 1908, preventing all tidal input into the marsh, but still allowed freshwater discharge through flap gates at low tide. The dike failed to achieve its purpose as an agricultural drainage system and mosquito control device even after further channelization and ditch construction. In an effort to restore the marsh, the dike was modified in 1975 to allow some seawater inflow during only semidiurnal tides. Summer and episodic hypoxia have recurred despite restoration efforts. Hypoxic events here result in fish kills and have caused the decline of the alewife fishery in the river. Land use within the watershed is sparsely residential with domestic wastewater disposal systems. ",

The Great Bay discharges to the Piscataqua River at Dover Point, which runs to the Atlantic Ocean between New Hampshire and Maine. Its outlet is located at Dover Point, and it is composed of high energy tidal waters, fringing mudflats, and deep channels. Episodic suboxic events have been observed in the bay itself in the past decade and suboxic conditions are common in the tidal portions of the Squamscott, Lamprey, and Oyster rivers that flow into the bay. Suboxia is defined as dissolved oxygen concentrations below the recommended 5 mg\/L, but not as low as 2 mg\/L (hypoxic). Suboxic conditions are considered to mark the threshold for biological stress in aquatic systems. In the past, hypoxic conditions have also been reported within the bay. A total of 2.8 square kilometers in the tidal rivers are affected by persistent suboxic conditions. The total nitrogen load in the Great Bay has increased by 42 percent in the last 5 years, largely due to greater stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution loads during recent high rainfall years. Eelgrass cover, an aquatic species that plays a critical role for habitat and filtration in the bay's ecosystem and is sensitive to excess nutrients, has declined by 37 percent between 1990 and 2008.",

  "Comment ": "Eutrophication and subsequent hypoxia in Long Island Sound is considered to result from the region’s large population and associated influence on nutrient sources\/pathways leading to high nutrient (particularly nitrogen) inputs into the system. Main sources of nitrogen within the catchment include atmospheric deposition from power plants and vehicles, agricultural runoff, and partially treated sewage discharge from wastewater treatment plants. Hypoxia in Long Island Sound tends to occur during summer months (June-September); during 1987-2010 the maximum extent of hypoxia within the sound averaged 195 square miles. However, the total area of hypoxia has reduced in the last 11 years with the summer of 2010 being one of the least severe covering 101 square miles and lasting 40 days (14 days less than average). Oxygen levels declined from the 1990s to 2000s with 1994 being the worst year yet. Effects of eutrophication and hypoxia are exacerbated in the western basin due to its poor flushing capacity (i.e. long water renewal time). Harmful algal blooms (HABs) (Alexandrium fundyense) have been reported as recently as 2007-2008 affecting several harbors including Northport, Centerport, and Huntington. The 2008 HAB event lasted 6 weeks and was responsible for elevated levels of water toxicity (through HAB-derived toxins) leading to the closure of 10,000 acres of shellfish beds by local authorities. Declines in oyster and lobster populations occurred in the late 1980s and 1990s, although high mortality rates observed are considered to be the result of parasitic diseases and high temperatures.  Reports indicate that around 30 percent of the sound benthos have been impacted by hypoxia. Problems with PCBs, poor sediment quality, and presence of pathogens have also been reported. ",

  "Comment ": "Cape Fear is a 202 mile long blackwater river that flows into the Atlantic Ocean from east central North Carolina, draining the larger part of North Carolina. The Cape Fear is the only major estuary in North Carolina that has relatively free and direct access to the ocean, resulting in significant tides and tide affected flow within the estuary. Oxygen levels were low in the Cape Fear River in 1971, but not hypoxic until the 1990s. Many researchers believe that the lacustrine environments created by dams along the river contribute to phytoplankton bloom development. The estuary is also the most industrialized estuary in the state, facing rapid growth of chemical industries.",

  "Comment ": "Galveston Bay is the largest estuary on the Texas coast. It is hypoxic with the most severe areas closest to the coast, and is part of the regional water quality monitoring program. The bay is heavily industrialized with petrochemical plants that pollute the area. It is also experiencing increasing suburban development. Both trends are contributing to losses in critical wetland habitat at a faster rate than anywhere else along the coast, diminishing the filtering capacity of the wetlands. Periodic channel dredging associated with commercial harvest practices are also significant threats. The bay faces localized oxygen-depletion in bottom waters where there is reduced mixing throughout the water column. The susceptible channels are usually deep, farthest removed from tidal exchange, or tertiary bays or tributaries with little mixing, low flow, or pollutant loadings. ",

The main tributaries entering the bay include the Susquehanna, Patuxuent, Potomac, Rappahannock, James and York Rivers. The once productive crab, oyster and menhaden fisheries have been severely diminished as a result of poor water quality in the bay. The Bay receives nutrients and sediments from agricultural runoff, atmospheric deposition, and urban wastewater.

  "Comment ": "Budd Inlet is a southern arm of Puget Sound which receives riverine inputs from the Deschutes River. The city of Olympia, Washington is located at the southern end of Budd Inlet. Some major sources of pollution in Budd Inlet are stormwater runoff and pipe discharge as well as industrial pollution from shipping berths at the nearby port. High nitrogen loads and stratification in the summer months make Budd Inlet susceptible to eutrophication impacts. The inlet is also characterized by restricted flushing (long water renewal time) and it is therefore considered to be prone to eutrophication and hypoxia. In the early 1990s, dissolved oxygen levels were measured at 2 mg\/l and 3 mg\/l, indicating hypoxic events. A more recent survey by Washington State in 2002 showed slight improvements in dissolved oxygen (4 mg\/l), but levels still indicate presence of near-hypoxic events that may be causing biological stress. Fecal coliform bacteria contamination (> 14 organism counts\/100 ml) is reported to be chronically persistent in the system. ",

The lake plays a crucial role in the region's economy, being an important source of food and livelihood for many inhabitants of the area. Additionally, its economic importance is highlighted due to its connection to the adjacent Caribbean Sea and associated shipping routes. The lake is fed by over 30 rivers\/streams, with the Catatumbo River accounting for approx. 70 percent of the total freshwater input. Nutrient enrichment in the lake derives from multiple sources including agricultural and human wastes within the catchment of the Catatumbo River (from Venezuela and Colombia) as well as small population settlements surrounding the lake. In addition, the city of Maracaibo contributes with urban runoff and directly discharges sewage at the northern end of the lake while Industrial activity also includes chemical refineries, tanneries, slaughterhouses, coal mines, etc, which often dump discharges into the river\/lake. A harmful algal bloom (HAB) (lemna family) was observed in the lake during 2004, covering a large portion of the lake. Reportedly, there was a possibility of more HABs and hypoxic conditions occurring if enrichment trends continued. The government spend 2 million dollars per month trying to alleviate the problem. Also, an on-going research project on the Lemna problem was established.  While the system is classified as eutrophic, potential for hypoxia to develop is high. ",

It is connected to the Tasman Sea by a short channel. In 1983, an environmental audit of Lake Macquarie identified sediment and nutrient enrichment (eutrophication) as the primary causes of water quality impairment in the lake. Accelerated sedimentation levels were estimated at 75,000 tones (73,815 long tons) per annum and nutrient levels had shown a substantial increase as a result of urbanization.  In 2000, officials drafted the Lake Macquarie Action Plan which established clean-up goals for the lake, with an emphasis on managing stormwater. By 2006 the lake had already shown vast improvements with reduced nutrient loads and healthy dissolved oxygen levels. Fish stocks have also begun to recover as a result of improving water quality and the removal of commercial fishing.",

Oil-related pollution events are also common in the bay. The aquaculture facility is also regarded as a source of pollution. A number harmful algal blooms and fish-kill events have taken place in the bay during the last decade, attributed to human-induced stress including eutrophication and other forms of pollution. Major fish-kill events were recorded in 1999 and 2001. The reason behind fish-kill events has been hypothesized to be a conjunction of natural stress along eutrophic conditions (and harmful algal blooms) and other forms of pollution. ",

  "Comment ": "Laucala Bay is located between Fiji's capital Suva and the River Dewa delta. Reports indicate an increase in nutrient concentration in the system during 1981-1998 (particularly phosphorus). Nitrogen and phosphorus levels recorded in 2003 were high enough to classify the system as eutrophic. The high concentration of P was in part attributed to the discharge of partially treated sewage from the Kinoya sewage treatment plant. The sewage plant was then subject to improvements. Subsequent studies between the years 2003-2005 indicated that the system was still under nutrient stress, with two to ten times the levels of nutrients than the unpolluted sites in Fiji. Additionally, primary productivity was reported to be nitrogen limited, and no major changes were observed in nutrient concentrations between the period of the investigation. The latter suggesting that the sewage plant effluent only accounts for a minor proportion of nutrients and future mitigation measures should take into consideration other major point sources and nonpoint sources. There are several other forms of pollution in the system including frequent oil slicks, litter, heavy metals (e.g. cadmium), and bacterial (fecal) contamination (e.g. e. coli). ",

In addition, several other smaller rivers contribute to freshwater inputs into the area (e.g. Drini, Mati, Ishimi, Erzeni, Samani, etc). The Buna river plume contains high nutrient concentrations (e.g. dissolved inorganic nitrogen), which are even higher than those of the Po River Delta in the highly eutrophic Northwestern Adriatic. Chlorophyll-a concentrations are also elevated and have been reported to be similar to the Northern Adriatic. Elevated chlorophyll concentrations extend northward for more than 150 km along the coast of Albania and Montenegro in the eastern Adriatic. The eutrophic condition of the area has been attributed to a combination of anthropogenic and natural freshwater inputs into the coast.  ",

The estuary was known for its rich biodiversity which has been negatively impacted and reduced by industrialization and urban encroachment. The system is considered to be under considerable stress (eutrophic) attributed to anthropogenic influence and to the physical characteristics of the estuary. Since the mid 1970s, anthropogenic activity has increased considerably in the area generating massive amounts of industrial and domestic wastes per day which are directly release without treatment into the system. The concentration of nutrients and chlorophyll-a has been found to be high in comparison to other eutrophic estuaries such as the Hudson Bay, San Francisco Bay, Pearl estuary, etc. Concentration of nutrients and chlorophyll-a varies spatially across the estuary with higher concentrations observed in areas characterized by restricted flushing. The complex morphology of the estuary is also considered to exacerbate the eutrophic conditions. Similarly, engineering modifications in parts of the estuary lead to restricted flushing. Biodiversity of plankton and macrobenthos has also significantly declined with opportunistic species found in stressed areas. Sediments have been found to be highly organically enriched, in part associated with reduced grazing and subsequent settlement of phytoplankton at the bottom of the estuary. Fish-kill events, related to the elevated organic pollution in the system, have also been reported in multiple occasions. Eutrophic conditions and manifestations are likely to intensify in the future in view of projected developments in the area. ",

The bay has limited connection to the neighboring sea resulting from engineering works in the 1960s, involving the construction of artificial dams in the south and east of the bay. Currently, only two inlets allow communication of the bay with the sea. The system is influenced by the outflows of the streams Mulinello, Marcelino and Cantera. The bay is one of the most important commercial harbours of Italy and industrial activity is prominent involving ship repair\/maintenance, cargo trade, in addition to being home to one of the most important petrochemical centers worldwide. High concentrations of phosphorous and nitrogen have been recorded in the bay and are mainly attributed to the discharge of untreated or partially treated urban and agricultural wastes. Additionally, industrial production of fertilizers is a source of nutrients in the bay. The bay is considered to be under significant stress from urban and heavy industrial pressure. Although certainly experiencing eutrophic conditions, there has been no indication of hypoxia occurring in the water column or water-sediment interface. Here, one of the main issues leading to eutrophic conditions is considered to be the limited exchange of water with the adjacent sea. The confinement of the bay from the sea leads to long water renewal time which in turn leads to limited flushing of nutrients and stress.  Moreover, marine sediments within the bay have been reported to be polluted by heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Research using benthic foraminifera indicated deteriorated conditions at the benthic zone, but highlighted the difficulties in identifying the factor(s) responsible for such deterioration given the several stressors present in the system.

  "Comment ": "The Sarno River mouth is located in the Tyrrhenian Sea between Torre Annunziata and Castellammare di Stabia, just southwest of Naples. The Sarno is the heaviest polluted river in Italy subject to heavy agricultural, domestic, and industrial discharges. Much of the coastal zone of the basin and inland areas is heavily urbanized and industrialized. Anthropogenic activity within the basin is responsible for the introduction of high amounts of chemical (e.g. heavy metals), organic, and microbial pollutants into the river which is eventually carried onto the estuary. In the coastal zone, oxygen conditions have been reported to be low and seawater is highly turbid reflecting the stress in the system. Conditions have been known to affect natural patterns of the regional ichthyofauna, with unfavorable conditions for migratory species of eels and mullet. Extensive meadows of seagrass (Posidonia Oceanica) which were formerly widespread have disappeared. Degradation of water quality in areas adjacent to the mouth is severe and the area is considered to be unfit for recreational activities. Here, high bacterial concentrations have been responsible for the continuous spread of oral-faecal diseases (e.g. typhus, salmonellosis, hepatitis) in the region. Eutrophication was first observed here in the 1970s, and was possibly an issue before then. While this system is classified here as eutrophic, it is likely that it has or experiences hypoxia.",

  "Comment ": "Mazatlan Bay is a subtropical embayment located in the Gulf of California (south-east). The natural nutrient loading of the bay is altered through untreated sewage and primary treated sewage discharges from the south portion of the city and the port.

Although no continuous measurements are available, an increase in the population during the last 20 years is considered to be reflected in an increased nutrient load within the bay. Measurements of nutrient levels and subsequent comparison with trophic indexes have indicated that the bay is predominantly eutrophic. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) (red tides) are a natural feature in the Gulf of California resulting from upwelling processes. However, during the last decade, the frequency of HABs has increased significantly with several cases of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) through consumption of bivalve mollusks. Currently, red tides in the bay are considered to be the result of both upwelling and cultural eutrophication.  ",

  "Comment ": "Progreso and Sisal are coastal towns in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Progreso has approximately 50,000 residents and a similar tourist occupation during summer months. The town is home to an important port in the region which extends 6 km into the sea due to the shallowness of the littoral zone. A recent water quality assessment of the coastal zone reports deteriorating and eutrophic conditions. Domestic sewage seepage is considered to be the main source of nutrients in the coast which is considerably higher during summer months. The latter is associated with higher tourist occupancy during that period. In addition, modifications to local hydrodynamic patterns attributed to the extensive harbor lead to poor water flushing and exacerbate stress. The phytoplankton community is governed by dinoflagellates and harmful algal blooms have been reported in the area (e.g. Pyrodinium spp.).  Seagrass assemblages have a low cover and are being replaced by macroalgae as a result of eutrophic conditions. There is currently no seagrass cover in the first kilometer offshore. Hypoxic conditions (<2 mg\/l) have been reported in the hypolimniom.  There is currently no wastewater treatment plant in Progreso or adjacent areas while population and industrial activities are expected to increase in the near future. Sisal is a small town of less than 5000 residents where an extensive aquaculture complex of 480 ha is present and continues to grow while there is no wastewater treatment in the area. Here, shrimp-farm effluents have been reported to increase the nutrient loading of the coastal zone causing eutrophication. High concentrations of ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, silicates, phosphates, and chlorophyll-a have been recorded next to the shrimp-farm and harbour effluents. Shrimp-ponds are fertilized with nitrate and silicates also inducing eutrophication. Similar to Progreso, seagrass assemblages have a low cover and are being replaced by macroalgae as a result of eutrophic conditions.

Most of the nutrient inputs into the estuary are discharged daily from adjacent oxidation ponds. The estuary is considered to be very eutrophic with nutrient levels exceeding national water guidelines and its waters declared unsuitable for recreational purposes in the past. There is also indication that ammonium-nitrogen levels may be high enough in some parts of the estuary to be toxic for certain aquatic species at times.  Nutrient pollution in the system has been reported to have somewhat improved. Before the 1970s, blooms of Ulva spp. and other algae were common, but thanks to the release of pond effluents with the outgoing tide, most nutrients are taken out of the estuary reducing macroalgal growth. Additionally, an offshore ocean pipeline removes more than 90 percent of nutrients and other pollutants from the estuary. Shellfish has been reported to have settled in areas where they had previously disappeared while cockle beds also seem to be better established in comparison with 50 years ago. Nevertheless, nuisance algal blooms are still reported, creating algal mats in the shoreline which cause sediments to become anoxic impacting benthic fauna. Discharges into the estuary also lead to the proliferation of heavy metals, sediments and pathogens. ",

The estimated nitrogen inputs into the estuary are in the order of 200-250 mg.m2.day (as estuary areal load) which is above the 50.mg.m2.day upper limit suggested for healthy (non-eutrophic) temperate tidal lagoons. Reportedly, there has been a substantial increase in the amount of nuisance macroalgae in the estuary. During 2009, decomposing macroalgal mats and hypoxic sulphide-rich sediments were present in many parts of the estuary.  Macroalgae was found to be at a higher density in sheltered embayments characterized by restricted water flushing. Water clarity tends to be low while faecal coliform levels are elevated.

Nutrient inputs into the lake consist of runoff from a predominantly agricultural catchment as well as wastes from several town sewerage systems. The lake has been described as hypereutrophic resulting from the long intensive farming within the catchment and high inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus. In the past, the lake was described as a macrophyte-dominated clear water system. However, a severe storm in the 60s eliminated the macrophyte cover and since then the lake has shifted to a turbid phytoplankton dominated system. Due to the shallowness of the lake and efficiency of mixing (by wind) in the water column, the lake is considered to be free from massive phytoplankton blooms and hypoxic conditions. Commercial fish stocks in the lake have been reported to have declined (e.g. eels). The benthic community has been reported to be poor and characteristic of stressed systems with a very limited number of species present. ",

Today, the lagoon is subject to extensive drainage while catchment landuse is dominated by intensive animal farming leading to increased surface runoff. The lagoon has been classified as eutrophic by New Zealand standards given its nutrient concentration and occurrence of macrophyte and phytoplankton blooms. Nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentration in the water column have been found to be elevated and are particularly so during periods of limited connectivity with the sea. Anoxic sediments have also been observed in the lagoon and tend to be found in areas dominated by macrophyte blooms. The lagoon is a shallow poorly flushed system with long water residence time and it is therefore considered to be particularly susceptible to the effects of high nutrient loading. Removal of natural wetlands and subsequent lost of their buffering properties is also considered to increase nutrient and sediment loading into the lagoon.  ",

In Karachi, huge amounts of domestic and industrial sewage are discharged into the coast and delta from the Malir and Lyari rivers. Estimates indicate that approximately 6,000 small and large scale industries discharge untreated effluent into the coast.  Fish-kills in the Karachi coast and the nearby Gwadar Bay have been attributed to harmful algal blooms resulting from increasing organic pollution. The green Noctiluca scintillans has been reported to be present along the coast and surrounding areas in high quantities. Due to the high amount of organic pollution, oxygen levels along the coast are estimated to be low. Other forms of pollution include oil products with around 90,000 tons per year dumped into the coast from vessels and the port. Extremely high levels of toxic heavy metals are also common in coastal water and are likely to have significant impacts on humans and marine wildlife.

  "Comment ": "Dutch Canal is part of a wetland system also comprising Chilaw Lagoon, Mundel Lagoon and Puttalam Lagoon in the Puttalm District of Sri Lanka (North-West). Most of the expanding aquaculture industry of Sri Lanka is established in the area. Since the 1980s, the industry has rapidly expanded without any organization or planning. Today, Dutch Canal is a highly eutrophic system with serious water quality problems. The high nutrient loading is caused by the direct discharge of nutrient-rich effluents derived from shrimp farms. The industry has been negatively impacted by the eutrophic conditions of the lagoon as evidenced by a significant decline in shrimp output caused by the outbreak of viral diseases. In addition, there has been a decrease in the lagoon’s fish harvest with obvious implications for local fisherman. Part of the problem lays in inadequate management techniques. Dutch Canal is the main source of water for shrimp farms in the area but at the same time farm effluents are discharged into the canal. Hence, the potential for eutrophication and stress in the system is very high. Additionally, the lagoonal complex is characterized by limited flushing, with water renewal time in some areas (e.g. Puttalam Lagoon) of approximately 20-100 days. Accordingly, flushing of water with a high nutrient load is very limited. By the year 2008, there was a government proposal to rehabilitate the canal, but some have suggested that reducing pollution sources would be more economical and beneficial for the parties involved.

The water quality of the system has been reported to be affected by non-point sources of sewage pollution from both Corozal and the neighboring Mexican town of Chetumal. The latter has been reported to have experienced a significant increase in population since 2000 leading to increased stress on the system. Currently, there is no appropriate sewage treatment plant in Chetumal and only partially treated sewage is discharged into the system. In Corozal, sewage management takes the form of latrine pits, septic tanks, and soak-aways, which taking into consideration the underlying limestone geology of the area (i.e. porous), leads to leaching of nutrients into the bay. Other forms of nutrient inputs may include those deriving from sugar cane plantations, although it might depend on storm events. Also, livestock production may lead to nutrient leaching into the bay through the aforementioned porous geology\/pedology. Point sources include sugar processing plants generating wastewater which is discharged into the New River and subsequently flows into Corozal Bay. However, it is not known if it affects the water quality of the bay.  Garbage disposal sites at Corozal Town may also be contributing to nutrient seepage into the bay.

  "Comment ": "The GBR located in Australia’s northeastern coast is the largest continuous coral reef in the world and it is much valued for its biodiversity. Traditionally, the reef has been characterized by good ecological status and good water quality resulting from the relative lack of anthropogenic impacts due its remote location and effective regional management schemes. However, there has been an increasing concern on the anthropogenic impacts on certain areas of the GBR.  The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) is adjacent to a large catchment where a range of agricultural and industrial activity takes place. Here, nutrients and sediments inputs have been reported to have increased 2- to 4- fold in the last century.  The effects of terrestrial runoff seem to be predominant in a narrow nearshore zone of 15-20 km.  However, elevated nutrient concentrations have also been observed at hundreds of kilometers from river mouths. New (allochthonous) nutrient sources within the reef are dominated by river runoff accounting for 30 percent of the total nitrogen and 39 percent of the total phosphorous. Coral reefs in the area have experienced changes associated with eutrophication and terrestrial run-off. Results from a 2007\/2008 monitoring programme indicate that 10 out of 14 near shore stations had chlorophyll-a, suspended sediments and particulate nutrient values exceeding the recommended guideline values for the GBR. These high values were associated with flooding events and associated increased runoff. No problems with submerged aquatic vegetation (seagrass beds) were correlated to water quality. However, certain parts of the reef (Burdekin and Fitzroy) had an increased macroalgal cover compared to previous surveys. The increase in macroalgal cover is an important issue as macroalgae competes with coral species for cover and can therefore displace them. ",

  "Comment ": "The Mekong River is one of the longest rivers in Asia. Through its course, it drains areas of China, Burma, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam eventually discharging through its delta into the South China Sea. The total drainage area of the river is approximately 783,000 square kilometers. The river basin is influenced by increased population density and intensification of agricultural crop production. Agricultural land accounts for 80 percent of the total landuse in the delta. Discharge of agricultural runoff with high nutrient content has been a common issue during the last two decades. Even so, the effects of eutrophication seem to be localized, and the water quality in the delta and river as a whole is considered to be generally good. Eutrophic symptoms seem to be concentrated in upstream reaches around Phnom Penh (Cambodia) and lower reaches in the Mekong Delta, which is characterized by the highest population density of the region. Here, eutrophication events occur annually and have been categorized as moderate. Although data on the extent of eutrophication in the region is not thorough, associated symptoms may include: increased algal production and the formation of algal mats, hypoxia, fish and benthos mortality events, or harmful algal blooms (HABs). Levels of faecal bacteria in distributaries of the River Delta make the water unsuitable for human consumption.  During 1999, the aquaculture industry lost millions of dollars due to eutrophic conditions and associated toxic algal blooms. Shellfish poisoning from toxic phytoplankton has also been reported in the area. In general, studies on the impacts of eutrophication and HABs in the delta seem to be scarce.",

  "Comment ": "The Gulf of Tonkin borders the Indo-Chinese coast to the west and the western coast of Lai Chau Peninsula and Hai Nam Island to the east. The gulf is characterized by its shallowness not exceeding 100 m. The hydrological regime of the gulf is heavily influenced by a huge continental runoff delivered by a network of rivers. Industrial development, increasing population growth and agricultural runoff are considered the main sources contributing to eutrophication in the delta. Reportedly, untreated industrial waste and municipal sewage are discharged directly into the delta’s waterways. The amount of organic inputs into surface waters should be significant taking into consideration that large urban centers such as Hanoi are located within the delta. Input of nitrogen in the form of runoff from excessive fertilizer application is also an issue where rice is cultivated. In the Gulf of Tonkin, heavy siltation and eutrophication have played a major role in reshaping the structure and composition of the coral reef community. These two factors have led to the displacement and elimination of certain coral species and replacement by others, leading to a unique coral composition in the bay. Many of these species are considered opportunistic being able to withstand stressful conditions. This is the case in Ah Thoi and Ha Long Bay, with turbid and highly eutrophic waters and where surveys have revealed the predominance of opportunistic species (porites) in the coral reef structure.

Besides the Chehalis, many lesser rivers and streams flow into Grays Harbor, such as Hoquiam River and Humptulips River. Grays Harbor receives high riverine inputs, exhibits stratification, and has high levels of fecal coliform contamination and  ammonium-N. Low dissolved oxygen has not been a problem in the bay as it has a good exchange with oceanic waters. Washington state has classified Grays Harbor as a waterbody of significant concern due to its eutrophic status. ",

A line drawn from Point Defiance in the southwest to Browns Point in the northeast serves to mark the generally accepted division between the bay and the open sound. Commencement Bay has become home to one of the most active commercial ports in the world. The Port of Tacoma is the main port facility. Commencement Bay suffers from consistently high level of fecal coliform contamination as well as episodes of low oxygen. Low dissolved oxygen was first observed here in 1996\/1997 when there were seven occurrences of DO levels dropping below 5 mg\/l. Low dissolved oxygen is the result of eutrophication (from urban runoff) and stratification. Commencement Bay has been classified as one of the waterbodies of highest concern by the Washington Department of the Environment. ",

  "Comment ": "Rarotonga has the highest population density (c. 14,153) in all of the Cook Islands. Here, point and non-point sources of sewage and\/or agricultural runoff have been correlated with the degradation of the lagoonal environment surrounding the island and to the emergence of fish disease. Ciguatera is a toxin derived from a toxic dinoflagellate (Gambierdiscus toxicus) associated with nutrient rich waters. The dinoflagellate tends to aggressively colonize areas of the reef exposed to disturbance. Poisoned fish are a direct threat to the inhabitants of the island while also posing a risk to tourists. Several fish species have been found to be inflicted with the toxin. Reports indicate that the fish stock of the island has been significantly reduced in the last few decades resulting from the deterioration of the lagoonal environment. However, the use of nets, poisons and explosives in fishing practices may also be correlated to fish decline.  A survey of the area reported a high rate of parasitic organisms (Plagioporus spp.) in corals which has been correlated with sewage. Additionally, coral bleaching has been observed and the presence of filamentous algae is also damaging corals. Some areas seem to be more vulnerable than others resulting from differences in flushing efficiency in parts of the lagoon. A comparison of coral communities among similar Pacific reefs found that Rarotonga had the highest coral mortality index and lowest hard coral diversity.  ",

The estuary comprises Skidaway River, Wilmington River and Wassaw Sound which are considered to be a contiguous zone due to the local tidal action. The estuary is also influenced by freshwater inputs from the Savannah and Ogeechee Rivers. A series of surveys between 1986—2005 found a number of harmful algal bloom (HAB) species the estuary (n = 15). In particular, annual mean and peak abundances of Heterosigma akashiwo have been correlated to increased nutrient loading and subsequent eutrophication. This HAB taxon is known to benefit from increased nutrient concentrations and has been associated with fish and shellfish kills in the US Atlantic coast. Here, changes in nutrient concentration are attributed to increased population density, changes in landuse practices along Georgia’s coast and upstream in the rivers drainage basins. Eutrophic conditions are reflected by elevated chlorophyll-a and particulate organic matter as well as higher concentrations and abundance of small phytoplankton. Additionally, declining dissolved oxygen levels and elevated bacterial activity have been recorded in the estuary.",

It has a drainage basin of five square miles (thirteen square kilometers). The river is known for attracting manatees due to the natural springs which feed the river and help maintain a warm water temperature in the river and bay. In recent years, Crystal River has suffered  from severe algal blooms. The symptoms of eutrophication have been made worse as a result of pumping of the aquifer that feeds the springs, resulting in reduced freshwater flow to the river and allowing for a concentration of nutrients. In addition, the dredge and fill of nearby wetlands has diminished the flow and filtration of water to the river. ",

The area is subject to heavy anthropogenic influence from the port, a nearby dumpsite, an electrical power plant, and the urban areas of Mombasa and its surroundings. Although Mombasa was reported to be the only Kenyan coastal town with a sewerage system (as of 2001), overloading and lack of maintenance have resulted in a general collapse of the system since the early 1990s. Most of Mombasa’s population relies on pit latrines for liquid waste while solid wastes are collected and dumped directly into the shores of Makupa Creek. A series of studies found low dissolved oxygen concentrations ranging from 3.60 – 5.90 (mg\/l) indicating biological stress and close to hypoxic conditions. Similarly, chlorophyll-a concentrations were found to be high (2.05 – 8.00 mg\/l) while secchi disk transparency is indicative of highly eutrophic conditions (0.30 – 1.40 cm). Connection of the creek with the sea is often limited leading to poor flushing conditions while exacerbating stress. Reportedly, mangrove cover and populations of edible fish and crustaceans have been almost completely lost. A survey of phytoplankton species in the area found a (copepod) community representative of a degraded system. Further research in the creek and harbour is recommended to properly assess the damage of the system.",

Groundwater discharges are likely a major vector of nutrients from certain villages and hotels along the coast. A survey of water quality parameters in coral reefs in the area (Chapwani Island) concluded that nutrient concentrations were significantly higher when compared to other coral systems considered to be (or have been) eutrophic (e.g. Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, USA). Chlorophyll-a concentrations were also found to be high in comparison to other systems. Additionally, there is indication of displacement of coral species by fast-growing benthic communities (e.g. a soft coral of Rhodactis spp.) thriving from elevated nutrient conditions.

The coastal area of Dar es Salaam is located in the Indian Ocean receiving inputs from the rivers Msimbazi, Kizinga, Mzinga and their tributaries. The Msimbazi is one of the most polluted rivers in Tanzania while the immediate coast of Dar es Salaam is also considered to be heavily polluted. There are multiple sources of pollution within the Msimbazi catchment including industrial sewage effluents, raw solid-waste disposal sites, a slaughterhouse effluent outfall, multiple unplanned settlements and industrial\/commercial establishments. More than 70 percent of the residents of the city live in unplanned settlements with no access to proper sanitary and waste management infrastructure. Many of these settlements are established alongside the rivers and its tributaries. Wastes from these areas are likely a major cause of pollution in the river eventually reaching coastal areas, particularly taking into consideration that only 15 percent of the population of the city has access to a sewerage system.  Additional sources of pollutants include derivatives from urban agriculture and animal grazing which are common in the city. A survey of the Msimbazi River reported a high Biological Oxygen Demand and dissolved oxygen levels close to anoxia (as low as 0.9 mg\/l). Accordingly, aquatic life in parts of the rivers close to Dar es Salaam Harbour may not even be present. Aquatic invertebrates in the river reflect stressed conditions with a high prevalence of pollution tolerant species. Heavy metal and pesticides residues are present at high concentrations within the system and have been correlated to growth impairment and physical deformities of the aquatic biota.",

The inner zone of the estuary is characterized by high turbidity from fine sediments and by elevated organic matter content. Freshwater input largely consist of the Sauce Chico and Naposta Grande Rivers with several smaller and ephemeral streams contributing to a lesser degree. A series of surveys aimed to identify different physico-chemical and biological parameters (e.g. chlorophyll-a) indicate that the inner zone of the estuary is eutrophic. This seems to be particularly the case on the main channel of the estuary. The elevated nutrient concentration is considered to be the result of high anthropogenic activity. The area has significant urban and industrial development being an important natural harbour in the region. Shipping, dredging and dumping of waste loads are common in the area. Seasonal phytoplankton blooms are common in the estuary. Oxygen conditions are generally good which could be the result of regional wind patterns and a well-mixed water column.  ",

  "Comment ": "The Gulf of Oman is located in the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula. The Strait of Hormuz connects the Gulf of Oman with the Arabian Gulf. During 2008-2009, there was a significant harmful algal bloom (HAB) event in the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz (expansion > 500 square kilometerss) attributed to the dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoide. The event lasted for more than eight months and caused massive fish mortality (thousands of tons) affecting the fishing industry, damaging coral reefs, and having a detrimental impact on local tourism. Desalination plants in the area were forced to shut down. Effects on the coral structure were rapid and severe resembling impacts caused by coral bleaching. Analyses of physical and biological parameters at the time of the bloom indicated high chlorophyll-a concentrations (503.25 mg\/l) in surface water and low (hypoxic) dissolved oxygen levels (1.41 mg\/l) in the hypolimnium. Although the exact causes of the bloom are not entirely understood, a combination of eutrophication, climate change, ballast (species) transport, and low-flushing rates characterizing the Persian Gulf, may all be partially responsible for the event. Recent reports (as of 2010) have indicated new HABs in the area causing fish-kills and affecting coastal localities along the Iranian coast and the United Arab Emirates.",

  "Comment ": "The Palmones River Estuary is located in a small catchment (302 square kilometers) located close to the port-city of Algeciras with high population and a mixture of agricultural, urban and industrial land uses. The estuary is characterized by it shallowness and the river eventually empties into Algeciras Bay. Eutrophication symptoms in the estuary have been observed since the early 1990’s and are caused by high phosphorous concentrations. Traditionally, the main sources of nutrients have been urban and industrial activities including large amounts of organic sewage from nearby towns and waste effluents from both a paper mill and nearby industrial park. The effects of high nutrient concentration are likely exacerbated by reduced water exchange with Algeciras Bay caused by sediment accumulation in the river mouth. Sedimentation was partly associated to the renewal of a neighboring beach while water flow may depend on an upstream dam and weather conditions. In 1992, urban centers and the paper mill installed treatment plants to limit the amount of the nutrients entering the estuary. Even so, more recent reports indicate the system is still highly eutrophic (hypereutrophic) likely resulting from the synergistic effects of partially treated sewage, catchment-derived nutrients, long water renewal time, weather conditions, and the presence of a reservoir upstream of the Palmones. Studies looking at the macroinvertebrate community in the estuary (c. 1999) found that areas with long water renewal times were more acutely affected by organic pollution. Primary production patterns have also been affected by a shift from sea grass meadows to the dominance of phytoplankton and fast-growing macroalgae thriving thanks to their ability to rapidly uptake and store excess nutrients. Shellfish species of economic importance have diminished or may have even disappeared.",

  "Comment ": "La Albufera de Valencia (surface area = 22.3 square kilometers) is a coastal lagoon south of Valencia and about 7.5 Kilometers from the Turia River mouth. The lagoon is renowned for its natural beauty and ecological importance being an “international important wetland” under the Ramsar Convention. The lagoon is surrounded by marshlands mainly used for agricultural practices (rice fields and orchards) in addition to a number of resorts. Urbanization and industrialization of the catchment has been fast and progressive during the last 50 years and is considered to be the main cause of water quality problems in the lagoon by contributing to an excessive amount of nutrients and organic matter. The system receives untreated sewage water from urban sources as well as treated sewage from treatment plants. During rains highly polluted sewage enters the system through gutters. The shift from an oligotrophic to a eutrophic system (eventually leading to hypereutrophication) began in the 1960s as indicated by the disappearance of the original macrophyte-submerged vegetation of the lagoon. The system became turbid and algal dominated. Restoration efforts in 1991 aimed to mitigate the amount of nutrients entering the system by diversion of sewage effluents. Even so, hypereutrophic conditions are still observed and inputs deriving from agriculture remain untreated. Blue-green algal blooms fuelled by excessive nutrients are common in the system. Low oxygen levels have also been reported and associated with the high productivity of the system. The pelagic and benthic faunal assemblages have also experienced modifications associated with the trophic level with the disappearance of some native fish species.",

The main anthropogenic influence in the Ebro Delta is intensive agriculture, accounting for 65% of the total surface area and consisting mainly of rice fields. Eutrophication in the lagoon resulted in drastic changes in aquatic vegetation assemblages within the system. Submerged macrophyte cover disappeared by the late 1970s and the lagoon became a turbid system dominated by phytoplanktonic species.  At the time, reductions in stocks of commercial fish species and aquatic birds were reported. A number of ex-situ experiments demonstrated that high levels of nitrogen in the form ammonia - correspondent with substantial increases in phytoplankton abundance - drastically reduced the growth of the macrophyte species native to the lagoon. A number of restoration efforts were implemented in the early 1990s to address the eutrophication problem within the lagoon. Efforts included reduction of incoming agricultural inputs during rice growing season, use of freshwater directly from the Ebro River, etc. The latest reports indicate the original macrophyte vegetation has recovered by 100%, a clear indicator of the effectiveness of the measures taken.

The marsh has been designated as a natural park due to its ecological importance. Here, an extensive network of drainage ditches join in a single canal emptying nutrient-rich waters into Alcudia Bay. The marsh has a long history of anthropogenic influence dating back to the second half of the nineteen century. The marsh receives considerable runoff inputs during storm events and has a semi-continuous input of wastewater. Urbanization and touristic developments are common in the region, but agricultural sources are considered to be the main cause of eutrophication in the canal. Additionally, sporadic sewage discharge may also be responsible for high nutrient inputs. High levels of nitrates have been observed in the canal decreasing in a longitudinal gradient from the inner canal to the sea. Conditions in Alcudia Bay are oligotrophic and eutrophication seems to be limited to the outlet canal and adjacent areas. Phytoplankton blooms have been reported at certain times of the year in the channel while dissolved oxygen values ranging from 3.2 mg\/l to 15.6 mg\/l have been recorded. The low range oxygen values might be indicative of the presence of biological stress.",

  "Comment ": "Bedford Basin is a coastal embayment communicating with the Atlantic Ocean through Halifax harbour. The embayment is considered to be eutrophic receiving 5.6 million gallons per day of primary municipal sewage from neighboring Bedford and Sackville. Additionally, nutrient loading within the system may be affected by untreated sewage advection from the adjacent Halifax Harbour. Water exchange with the Atlantic has been considered as appropriate, but nevertheless eutrophic conditions seem to prevail. Phytoplankton (dinoflagellates) blooms have been reported in the area during summer. Recent data based on a long-term monitoring program indicates that oxygen levels in bottom waters tend to be low in the embayment and below the limits of local guidelines (7 mg\/l), but are relatively high in surface waters. Low oxygen conditions are likely the result of the geomorphology of Bedford Basin. Also, phytoplankton activity inferred from chlorophyll fluorescence indicates a consistent moderate to high activity. Contemporary data on fecal coliform bacteria concentration suggest elevated levels within the basin above the recommended for shellfishing in several stations. Analysis of long-term trends indicates a strong inter-decadal relationship between nitrogen and chlorophyll, suggesting cultural eutrophication.",

The system is subject to strong anthropogenic influence by the large urban centers surrounding it and served as a natural and practical recipient of urban wastes for many years. Urban effluents come primarily from domestic sources in the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth and are rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter. Additionally, nutrient loading within the system may be affected by primary municipal sewage entering Bedford Basin from neighboring Bedford and Sackville. A number of water treatment plants have been established in urban centers across the region in order to mitigate the effects of sewage pollution. Recently, failure of the Halifax treatment plant resulted in high levels of fecal coliforms in the Inner Harbour. Elevated levels have also been recorded in other parts of the harbour resulting in certain areas not being suitable for shellfishing and swimming according to local standards. Phytoplankton activity inferred from chlorophyll fluorescence indicates a consistent moderate to high activity. Phytoplankton blooms and fish-kill events have be observed in areas of the harbour during summer. Contemporary evidence suggests phytoplankton blooms after spring result from enhanced nutrient loading with anthropogenic origins.

  "Comment ": "St. John’s Harbour is an enclosed embayment in the southeast coast of Newfoundland serving as an important commercial center within the region. The harbour is heavily influence by the city of St. John having received untreated sewage from the city for decades. By the year 2003, an estimated 120 million liters of raw sewage and stormwater entered the harbour from St. John’s sewerage system. In addition, during rainfall events the amount of sewage and wastewater entering the harbour increased 4 to 5 fold. The first indicative records of organic pollution are from a study during 1969-1970 comparing St. John’s harbour to a similar coastal system unaffected by sewage inputs. The annual phytoplankton standing crop was found to be three times higher than the unpolluted harbour while low oxygen levels were observed and correlated with phytoplankton blooms during summer months. This was particularly the case in the central basin. Recent studies found high concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria (deriving from sewage) with the presence of some species harmful to humans when in contact with the harbour’s water. Ammonia is considerably high and might cause stress to aquatic organisms while phosphorous levels are also elevated and promote the growth of nuisance algae. Oxygen levels were also reported to be low in areas adjacent to sewage outfalls. During the last decade there has been an ongoing effort to improve conditions by the implementation of water treatment plants and additional measures. Accordingly, conditions in the system may have improved recently.",

The region is a major touristic destination and has experienced considerable growth since the 1980s. In the year 2007, approximately 5 million tourist visited Phuket. Poor water quality issues in Patong Bay have been reported since the 1980s. There are several nutrient sources in Patong Bay including point and non-point sources.  In general, nutrient concentrations show seasonal variability with a clear correlation between the monsoon season and increased nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations. Direct sewage discharges into the bay are numerous and include Pak Bang Canal located south of Patong Beach. A sewage treatment plant partially treats some wastewater discharged into the Canal, but by the year 2005 it was reported to be at full capacity and half of the sewage deriving from urban centers was directly discharged into the Canal with no treatment. One survey (c. 2007) found elevated nutrient concentrations with nitrates and phosphates exceeding the guidelines given by ASEAN Marine Water Quality Criteria (2008). Elevated nutrient concentrations during 2007 were associated with frequent algal blooms in the bay. Additionally, fecal bacteria concentrations are also considered to be elevated. Reports also associate degraded water quality with reductions in coral reef cover and fish species diversity. Nutrient concentrations and algal blooms have been associated with reductions in oxygen levels close to the threshold marking biological stress. Clearly, degradation of water quality in the area is a direct threat to the local tourism industry as complaints about poor coastal water quality and degraded coral reefs have increased.",

The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) is a protected area under US legislation consisting of > 2,800 nautical miles of islands, coastline and coral reefs. A large scale water quality monitoring program involving different participants has been in place in the FKNMS since the mid 1990’s. The FKNMS Water Quality Monitoring Project uses a spatial approach dividing the region into different areas based on regional water circulation patterns. In general, nutrient sources in the FKNMS are complex and diverse involving the interaction of different factors. Major freshwater sources in the FKNMS consist of the Shark River Slough system on Florida’s SW coast and the Taylor Slough\/C-111 Basin in eastern Florida Bay. Additionally, nutrient loading in the region is largely affected by regional\/local water circulation patterns, external marine inputs (e.g. Gulf of Mexico), and climatic phenomena. Water quality criteria in the FKNMS include organic carbon, nitrogen (e.g. TN, DIN), phosphorus (e.g. TP), chlorophyll-a, turbidity, etc. At a coarse scale, the FKNMS can be considered to have fair water quality. However, water quality in the FKNMS is best assessed at a finer spatial scale due to the range of factors and local conditions that have the potential to affect it. In general, phosphorus seems to be the limiting nutrient in most of the FKNMS. Phosphorus sources seem to be land-based with additional inputs from southward transport of coastal waters above Cape Romano. A common trend observed in several parts of the FKNMS are higher nitrate concentrations close to the shore suggesting anthropogenic sources. In terms of dissolved oxygen, the FKNMS exhibits a 15 year negative trend although median values do not indicate periodic hypoxia. Western Florida Bay is heavily influenced by water transported from Florida Bay, Shark River Slough, and the SW Florida Shelf. Contemporary data suggest that in comparison to other areas composing the FKNMS, the Western Florida Bay has a significantly higher nutrient concentration (silicates, phosphorus, total organic carbon) only surpassed by areas of the Lower Keys (Gulf-side), but with particularly low readily available dissolved inorganic nutrients. Total organic carbon and total organic nitrogen values are among the highest in most of the FKNMS and are considered to derive from both the SW Florida Shelf and Florida Bay. Nutrient concentrations in the Western Florida Bay are likely to have terrestrial origins and\/or are associated to the advection of water from the SW Florida Shelf and Florida Bay. High silicate concentrations were detected in areas characterized by dense seagrass meadows and hence benthic fluxes might be responsible for the high values recorded.  Phosphorous, chlorophyll-a and turbidity values show distinct N to S gradients in the area with turbidity being highest close to the shore. An investigative field survey (c. 1993) found evidence of hypoxia (< 5 mg\/l DO) at two sites in this part of the Lower Keys at Patch Reef (Lat 24.622 Lon -81.402) and Looe Key (Lat 24 32.906 Lon -81 23.845). Low oxygen values were observed after rainfall events and were attributed to the discharge of nutrient-laden stormwater and wastewater runoff. Recent data from the FKNMS Monitoring Project shows only one hypoxic recording at West Honda Bay during the summer of 2002.",

The Lower Keys are divided in the FKNMS spatial framework into two distinct segments, one comprising the Gulf-side (northern) part of the Lower Keys and one representing the Atlantic-side (southern) portion of the keys. The Lower Keys (Gulf-side) are characterized by shallow waters with an important influence from the SW Florida Shelf. Long-term monitoring data suggest that this part of the Lower Keys exhibits the highest nutrient concentration in all FKNMS. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon are particularly high in comparison to all other areas comprising the FKNMS. Here, nutrients transported from the SW Shelf and benthic fluxes are probably more important than anthropogenic influence. Nitrate concentrations in surface waters showed a decline during the last 15 years, but nevertheless remain high. Similarly, ammonia concentrations in the area are considered to be elevated. Local nitrate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen sources may include seepage from septic tanks and stormwater runoff from Big Pine Key, but other areas with no anthropogenic elements also show high nitrate concentrations. Due it to its shallowness (mean depth = 0.5 m) and hydraulic isolation from both the SW Shelf and Atlantic, parts of the Lower Keys have a long water renewal time which might lead to nutrient retention. Similarly, benthic processes and subsequent fluxes into the water column might contribute to the concentration of nitrogen in the Lower Keys and other parts of the FKNMS. Phosphorous, chlorophyll-a and turbidity values show N to S gradients in the area with turbidity being highest close to the shore. Prior to the establishment of the FKNMS, an investigative field survey (c.1993) found evidence of hypoxia (< 5 mg\/l DO) in this part of the Lower Keys at Port Pine canal (Lat 24.728 Lon -81.41) and Pine Channel (Lat 24.702 Lon -81.414). At these sites, low oxygen conditions were observed after rainfall events and were attributed to the discharge of nutrient-laden stormwater and wastewater runoff. Reportedly, there was evidence of biota mortality at the sea bottom. Data corresponding to the FKNMS management timeframe indicates several hypoxic readings at different points. Most hypoxic recordings in the FKNMS are concentrated in this area.  ",

The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) is a protected area under US legislation consisting of > 2,800 nautical miles of islands, coastline and coral reefs. A large scale water quality monitoring program involving different participants has been in place in the FKNMS since the mid 1990’s. The FKNMS Water Quality Monitoring Project uses a spatial approach dividing the region into different areas based on regional water circulation patterns. In general, nutrient sources in the FKNMS are complex and diverse involving the interaction of different factors. Major freshwater sources in the FKNMS consist of the Shark River Slough system on Florida’s SW coast and the Taylor Slough\/C-111 Basin in eastern Florida Bay. Additionally, nutrient loading in the region is largely affected by regional\/local water circulation patterns, external marine inputs (e.g. Gulf of Mexico), and climatic phenomena. Water quality criteria in the FKNMS include organic carbon, nitrogen (e.g. TN, DIN), phosphorus (e.g. TP), chlorophyll-a, turbidity, etc. At a coarse scale, the FKNMS can be considered to have fair water quality. However, water quality in the FKNMS is best assessed at a finer spatial scale due to the range of factors and local conditions that have the potential to affect it. In general, phosphorus seems to be the limiting nutrient in most of the FKNMS. Phosphorus sources seem to be land-based with additional inputs from southward transport of coastal waters above Cape Romano. A common trend observed in several parts of the FKNMS are higher nitrate concentrations close to the shore suggesting anthropogenic sources.

The Lower Keys are divided in the FKNMS spatial framework into two distinct segments, one comprising the Gulf-side (northern) part of the Lower Keys and one representing the Atlantic-side (southern) portion of the Keys. The latter is influenced by the Florida Current, and like all ocean-side segments of the FKNMS, by wind and transports from the Hawk Channel. Additionally, concentrations of silicates are considered to derive from transports from the Lower Keys (Gulfside) and the Western Florida Bay. Here, nutrient concentrations are not generally as high as in the Lower Keys (Gulfside) and the Western Florida Bay, but higher than in the Upper Keys.  As with all ocean-side segments of the FKNMS, a common trend is the decrease in values of water quality parameters from inshore stations to offshore stations. This is the case of silicates, phosphorous, organic carbon, turbidity, nitrates and ammonia. Comparison of the spatial distribution of nutrients along inshore-offshore transects in the FKNMS suggest that an anthropogenic source of nitrates and ammonia is present in this part of the Lower Keys. In the case of nitrogen, it is likely that concentrations are diluted with low nutrient waters from the Atlantic Ocean resulting in the inshore-offshore pattern observed. No dissolved oxygen measurements indicating hypoxia (< 5 mg\/l DO) have been reported in the Atlantic side of the Lower Keys.",

Water quality in the Middle Keys is primarily influenced by water transported from Florida Bay, and like all Atlantic-side segments of the FKNMS, by wind and transports from the Hawk Channel. Generally, nutrient concentrations in the Middle Keys seem to be higher than those of the neighboring Upper Keys and relatively par with the conditions of the Atlantic Lower Keys. In particular, total organic carbon and total organic nitrogen concentrations at inshore stations were among the highest observed in the whole FKNMS and were attributed to exchange with SW Florida Shelf and Florida Bay. Similarly, turbidity levels at inshore stations are among the highest observed in the FKNMS. Here, a common trend is the decrease of water quality parameters in an inshore-offshore direction. This is the case of silicates, organic carbon, turbidity, and a slight decrease in chlorophyll-a. Concentrations of silicates are considered to derive from transports from the Lower Keys (Gulfside) and the Western Florida Bay.

In terms of dissolved oxygen, the FKNMS exhibits a 15 year negative trend although median values do not indicate periodic hypoxia. Water quality in the Upper Keys is influenced by the Florida Current frontal eddies and by water transported from Biscayne Bay. Similar to other ocean-side transects in the FKNMS, the Upper Keys are influenced by wind and transports from the Hawk Channel. In comparison to other areas composing the FKNMS, water quality criteria in the Upper Keys can be considered to be superior. Nitrate concentrations are lower than in the Western Florida Bay, Lower Keys and Middle Keys. Ammonia, silicates, chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus concentrations also rank among the lowest in the FKNMS. In terms of inshore-offshore patterns, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a values slightly increase in an offshore direction indicating the presence of an offshore source associated with these two parameters. Even so, offshore chlorophyll-a values in the Upper Keys are among the lowest in all FKNMS. Like all Atlantic facing segments, nitrate, ammonia, organic carbon, and turbidity values decrease in an offshore direction. In the case of nitrate and ammonia, there is evidence suggesting an anthropogenic source of in the Upper Keys. In the case of nitrate, it is likely that concentrations are diluted with low nutrient waters from the Atlantic Ocean resulting in the inshore-offshore pattern observed. In the timeframe of the FKNMS management plan dissolved oxygen values indicating hypoxia (< 5 mg\/l DO) in the Upper Keys were recorded only twice at Plantation point (Lat 24.95012 Lon -80.56218) and Bowles Bank (Lat 25.49380 Lon -80.15010) during the year 2005.

  "Comment": "Tomales Bay is a long narrow inlet of the Pacific Ocean in Marin County in northern California in the United States. It is approximately 15 miles (25 km) long and averages nearly 1.0 miles (1.6 km) wide, effectively separating the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland of Marin County. It is located approximately 30 miles (48 km) northwest of San Francisco. The bay forms the eastern boundary of Point Reyes National Seashore. On its northern end it opens out onto Bodega Bay, which shelters it from the direct current of the Pacific. Bodega Harbor lies at the head of Bodega Bay. The Tomales Bay is formed along a submerged portion of the San Andreas Fault. Oyster farming is a major industry in the bay, and hillsides east of the bay are dotted by pastures and dairy farms. The bay receives nonpoint source nutrient inputs from riverine sources as well as runoff from the east and west shorelines. Sources of nutrients include runoff from animal waste (dairies and rangelands), failing septic systems, erosion of streambanks and roads, storm drains, and boating activities. Identified water quality impacts include seasonal closure of shellfish beds, high bacterial counts in several swimming areas along tributaries to the bay, and sedimentation of the estuary. Eutrophication has been a concern in the bay since the 1980s.",

Indian River Bay is unique among inland bays in that it is a drowned river valley, whereas Delaware's other bays are estuaries built on sand bars. Boating, fishing, shellfishing, and crabbing are among the most common recreational uses of Indian River Bay. In addition, the bay is bordered by several protected environmental areas, including Delaware Seashore State Park, Holts Landing State Park, and the Assawoman Wildlife Area. Agricultural and urban runoff are the major sources of nutrient pollution to the bay. Episodic hypoxia has been observed since the 1980s.\n\n",

It also has an outlet to the Atlantic Ocean via a lock into Port Canaveral. The lagoon includes salt marshes, mangrove swamps, seagrass beds, drift algae, oyster bars, tidal flats, and spoil islands, providing habitats for many marine species. Commercial and recreational activities in the lagoon generate more than US$ 800 million annually for the local economy. The lagoon has suffered from eutrophication since the 1980's.",

It flows from Prince George's County in Maryland into Washington, D.C., where it joins with the Washington Channel to empty into the Potomac River at Buzzard Point. It is approximately 8.4 mi (13.5 km) long. One of the biggest problems facing the Anacostia River is raw sewage that enters the river and its tributaries due to antiquated sewer systems. The sewage creates a public health threat due to fecal coliform bacteria and other pathogens; it also impairs water quality and can create hypoxic conditions that lead to large fish kills.",

At the bay's northern end, where it narrows between Assateague and Sinepuxent Neck, it becomes Sinepuxent Bay; Chincoteague Bay's southern end drains into the Atlantic Ocean via Queen Sound and Chincoteague Inlet. No major river flows into Chincoteague Bay—its largest tributaries are Newport Creek in Worcester County and Swans Gut Creek in Accomack County. The bay is considered to be eutrophic, though no hyoxia has been observed here. Sources of nutrients to the bay include agricultural runoff  and septic systems. ",

It is approximately 444 mi (715 km) long and drains an area of 27,500 square miles (71,225 km²), covering nearly half of the land area of Pennsylvania and portions of New York and Maryland. The river empties into the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay, the ria of the Susquehanna, providing half of the freshwater inflow for the entire Chesapeake Bay. In 2003 the river alone contributed 44 percent of the nitrogen, 21 percent of the phosphorus, and 21 percent of the sediment flowing into the Chesapeake Bay. Sources of nutrients include agricultural runoff (manure and fertilizers), urban runoff, and discharges from wastewater treatment plants. \n",

The river is considered by the Environmental Protection Agency to be one of the most polluted waterways in Texas and contains a number of pollutants in high concentrations that are persistent in the water and riverbed. It has been under pressure for decades from industries located on and near its banks that used it as an effluent removal system for decades. Today the river has lost a large number of native fish species, suffers from periodic algae blooms and is on the verge of ecological collapse.\n\n",

Commencement Bay has become home to one of the most active commercial ports in the world. The Port of Tacoma is the main port facility. Commencement Bay suffers from consistently high level of fecal coliform contamination as well as episodes of low oxygen. Low dissolved oxygen was first observed here in 1996\/1997 when there were seven occurences of DO levels dropping below 5 mg\/l. Low dissolved oxygen is the result of eutorphication (from urban runoff) and stratification.

The Chehalis River flows into the eastern end of the bay where the city of Aberdeen lies at that river's mouth.  Besides the Chehalis, many lesser rivers and streams flow into Grays Harbor, such as Hoquiam River and Humptulips River. Grays Harbor receives high riverine inputs, exhibits stratification, and has high levels of fecal coliform contamination and  ammonium-N. Low dissolved oxygen has not been a problem in the bay as it has a good exchange with oceanic waters. Washington state has classified Grays Harbor as a waterbody of significant concern due to its eutrophic status. ",

Possession Sound connects the main Puget Sound basin to the south with Saratoga Passage and Port Susan to the north. The Snohomish River flows into Possession Sound at Port Gardner Bay. Low oxygen and phytoplankton blooms have been observed here since the 1950s. The waters of Possession Sound exhibit stratifiction, high ammonia concentrations, high dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and high fecal coliform concentrations, categorizing it as a waterbody of high concern. Stratification combined with riverine nutrient inputs from the Snohomish River as well as nutrient runoff from Port Everett contribute to eutrophic conditions. ",
